# personal-cloud
personal-cloud is a collection of How-To that we developed at April Software to run our software stack. We think it could be benefit to others. 

We decided  to run our own IT infrastructure based on the principle of being as less as possible dependent on commercial software or commercially supported open source software. 
There are pro and cons using commercial software or open source software. We believe in open source and to the power of the community. We think that it is the most sustainable approach. We believe in long term businesses.  
The open source ecosystem is very rich and provides everything you would need to build your own infrastructure. There are almost endless possibilities and picking up the different components that you would need to build you own infrastructure could be a challenging task.

We selected Debian as operating system. There are very good alternatives to Debian; which are eventually backed by commercial companies. Debian fits with the principle of being as less as possible dependent on commercial software and commercially supported open source software. Even do they remain open source software, some other distributions are governed mainly by the companies that support them. On the other end, Debian is governed by the Debian community. Again there are pro and cons and we can debate it years. Our intention is about sharing the knowledge we collected during the years operating the software stack we built.

The first brick of our infrastructure is what we called a Personal Cluster (As a reference to Personal Computer / PC).  Indi
The Personal Cluster takes of VMs and Storage.
From there w deploy Kubernetes Clusters our 

The first How-To are about installing a cluster.
Obviously there are commercial distributions or commercially supported 
We focused first on installing a cluster that would fit our requirements meaning a cluster with limited resources.
